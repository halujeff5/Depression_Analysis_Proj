# Depression_Analysis_Proj
Project to predict depression in individuals by doing NLP on their tweets. Using LIWC a sentiment recognition library, I was able to detect sadness in tweets and than give it a numerical rating. I than separated the ratings to >5 (sadness present) and categorized the dependent variable to depressed and not depressed. From there, I conducted NLP on the tweets and trained several ML model to test if I could predict 'depressed' or 'not depressed' based on the language on their tweets. The models I used were Multinomial Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest. The Logistic Regression model fared best with a 85% F1 score.

Further developments for this model include acheiving a higher F1 score with more robust data. We can ask professional psychiatrists the threshold for the sadness score that would indicate depression. And definitely using different social media platforms such as facebook would be more accurate since these posts tend to be longer. This model serves its purpose as a depression diagnostic tool if social media posts (tweets) are measured for a period of time with the same individual. It is easy to employ and gives fairly reliable results.
